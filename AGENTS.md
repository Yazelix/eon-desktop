### Local exceptions

No local exceptions.

## Canonical protocols

### AP-SCOPE-001 — User-owned scope

The user decides product and project scope. An agent may inspect, explain, test,
or make the smallest implementation needed for the chosen goal, but it must not
silently create a feature, compatibility promise, public surface, migration,
repository, or planning item outside that direction.

Required practice:

- Separate safe implementation details from choices that change product scope.
- State consequential assumptions; stop when a missing choice would materially
  change the result.
- Treat a terminal instruction such as “finish” as persistence, not broader
  authority.
- Keep useful out-of-scope observations as findings unless the user has chosen
  a durable planning destination for them.

### AP-CONTRACT-001 — Contract-driven changes

State the irreducible externally observable behavior before choosing the code
shape. Give durable contracts stable identifiers when later code, tests, or
repositories need to cite them.

Required practice:

- Name the consumer, trigger, observable result, and important failure behavior.
- Identify the current sources of truth and decide which one owner survives.
- Choose the cheapest check that can falsify the contract.
- Implement the smallest vertical slice that satisfies it.
- Update the contract first when an intentional behavior change is chosen.

Do not turn implementation details into contracts unless another component must
rely on them.

### AP-REFERENCE-001 — Evidence before code shape

Review the relevant sources before deciding architecture or implementation
shape. Memory, summaries, and reputation are discovery aids, not sufficient
evidence for a consequential decision.

Required practice:

- Read the affected local code, contracts, tests, and repository instructions.
- Inspect designated external references at the subsystem named by local rules.
- Record the concrete mechanism adopted, rejected, or left unresolved.
- Distinguish direct source evidence from inference.
- Revisit the evidence when the proposed shape changes materially.
- Apply source-license wording to the actors, uses, and conditions it actually
  names. Do not infer that an independent user or project acts on behalf of,
  for the benefit of, or under the direction of an agent or tool provider
  merely because the user selected that provider's service. Examples
  introduced by words such as “including” remain scoped by the condition they
  illustrate.
- Distinguish inspecting public source for ideas from copying, adapting,
  redistributing, selecting a dependency, or incorporating the source. A
  restriction on one of those actions does not silently erase required source
  inspection when the requested research itself remains permitted.
- If license interpretation would exclude required evidence, identify the
  exact clause, actor, beneficiary, direction, and requested use. Resolve a
  material ambiguity with the user instead of broadening the restriction by
  association or substituting reputation and secondary summaries for source.

Reference review is a decision gate, not a requirement to copy the reference.

### AP-MINIMAL-001 — Minimum sufficient implementation

Understand the affected flow before choosing the smallest complete solution.
Use the first option that fully satisfies the chosen contract:

1. Make no change when the required behavior already exists.
2. Reuse an existing owner, helper, or pattern in the repository.
3. Use the standard library or a native platform capability.
4. Use an already accepted dependency that owns the behavior.
5. Implement the minimum local code that is correct and maintainable.

Prefer deletion over addition, direct ownership over adapters, and fewer files
over scaffolding. Minimalism must not remove required behavior, trust-boundary
validation, data-loss protection, security, accessibility, or the cheapest
runnable check for non-trivial logic.

Ponytail is the adopted agent-side implementation of this discipline when the
host supports it. Use the upstream project directly rather than copying its
rules or adapters. The reviewed source is
[DietrichGebert/ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail/tree/16f29800fd2681bdf24f3eb4ccffe38be3baec6b).
If Ponytail is unavailable or disabled, the self-contained requirements above
still apply. Its instruction hooks improve consistency; they do not prove
compliance.

### AP-DEPENDENCY-001 — Dependency gate

Choose dependencies for architectural fit and net system simplicity, not name
recognition or short-term convenience.

Before adding a crate, package, framework, service, or embedded project:

- State the capability and contract it would own.
- Consider the standard library, owned code, and multiple credible candidates.
- Compare maintenance, platform fit, correctness, transitive weight, licensing,
  API stability, and the lines and complexity removed.
- Record the chosen candidate, meaningful rejections, and replacement cost.
- Pin deliberately and add the smallest check that proves the relied-on behavior.

Remove a dependency when it no longer owns enough behavior to justify its cost.

### AP-OWNERSHIP-001 — One owner per invariant

Every invariant, state transition, and user-visible policy must have one clear
owner. Other components may consume its output; they must not independently
reconstruct or reinterpret the same truth.

Required practice:

- Name the owner before adding adapters or synchronization.
- Prefer deleting duplicate owners over reconciling them.
- Keep policy at the highest layer that has the necessary context and mechanism
  at the lowest layer that can enforce it correctly.
- Make cross-boundary data explicit and versioned when independently released
  components depend on it.

### AP-TEST-001 — Strong and few tests

Tests exist to protect contracts, regressions, boundaries, and failure modes
that matter to users or future agents. Prefer one strong test with meaningful
setup and assertions over several thin tests.

Required practice:

- Use TDD for deterministic helpers, parsers, protocol behavior, and regressions
  when the expected behavior can be stated before implementation.
- Choose contract-first integration checks for layout, runtime integration,
  architecture choices, forks, and dogfooding surfaces.
- Delete or merge tests that duplicate another proof, assert implementation
  trivia, or preserve scaffolding.
- Test observable effects rather than mirroring literals, defaults, or source
  structure.
- Add absence guards only when absence is itself a security, licensing, size,
  ownership, or known-regression contract.

### AP-PROOF-001 — Explicit proof lifecycle

Claims and proofs have a lifecycle. A passing check supports only the exact
revision, environment, and surface it exercised.

Required practice:

- Record the command or observation, relevant environment, revision, and result.
- Distinguish proposed, implemented, mechanically verified, manually dogfooded,
  accepted, and promoted states.
- Re-run stale proof after relevant code, dependency, platform, or contract
  changes.
- Never promote a narrower check into a broader claim.
- Preserve important negative results; they constrain the next valid design.

### AP-PLAN-001 — Durable planning state

Keep the outcomes and constraints that later work needs in the project's
durable planning system or canonical documentation. An issue represents a
chosen goal, decision, material defect, or schedulable follow-up. Review and
implementation methods belong to that issue.

An agent run is one uninterrupted execution ending when control returns to the
user, including automatic continuations. A run may inspect any planning state
read-only, but it may create, claim, update, implement, or close at most one
Bead or repository-designated equivalent issue.

Required practice:

- When work is tracked by a Bead, bind the run to that one owning issue before
  its first issue write or implementation edit.
- After the owning issue is complete, blocked, or handed off, stop and return
  control to the user. Do not begin another issue, including work newly
  unblocked by the completion.
- Leave follow-up findings as reported findings for a later run. If issue
  creation is the requested outcome, the one issue created is that run's owning
  issue.
- After review, fresh-eyes, simplification, or verification, update the owning
  issue's editable fields to describe the accepted state instead of pass
  chronology.
- In a later run, create a separate issue only for a material finding outside
  the prior owning scope or one worth scheduling on its own. Name it after the
  outcome or finding.
- Record the contract, decision boundary, dependencies, acceptance evidence,
  material negative results, and rejected alternatives that constrain later
  work.
- Reserve append-only comments and audit records for chronology needed as
  evidence. Keep raw command logs and build transcripts with their proof. Omit
  baseline hashes, failed attempts, and candidate scoring unless they constrain
  later work.
- Keep issue status honest: planned, active, blocked, and complete are distinct.
- Model real prerequisites as dependencies; do not create decorative graphs.
- Reconcile planning state with the repository before handoff.
- Use the repository-designated issue tool and never edit its storage directly.

Do not erase approvals, contract changes, material failures, or evidence needed
to understand the accepted result.

### AP-CI-001 — Bounded continuous integration

Hosted automation must buy enough confidence to justify its financial,
latency, security, and maintenance cost.

Before enabling CI:

- Name the protected contract and why local verification is insufficient.
- Bound triggers, job count, timeouts, permissions, artifacts, cache growth, and
  concurrency.
- Prefer one cheap deterministic job before matrices or scheduled runs.
- Make fork and secret behavior explicit.
- Record the evidence required to expand, reduce, or remove the workflow.

Private-repository minutes and cache storage are product constraints, not an
invisible externality.

### AP-EXCEPTION-001 — Explicit local exceptions

A local rule may narrow, replace, or suspend an imported protocol only through
an explicit exception approved by the user or named project authority.

Each exception records:

- the protocol ID;
- its exact scope;
- the reason the canonical rule does not fit;
- who approved it and when;
- an expiry or review condition when the exception is temporary.

Unrecorded conflicts are drift. A local rule that merely adds detail without
changing the canonical requirement is an overlay, not an exception.

### AP-GIT-001 — Safe repository history

Repository history is shared user state. Preserve unrelated work, follow the
local branch and promotion model, and use the least destructive operation that
achieves the requested result.

Required practice:

- Inspect status and repository instructions before editing.
- Treat existing and concurrent changes as user-owned unless proven otherwise.
- Fold a correction into the current task's unpublished commit when it belongs
  to the same unit of work. Refresh and reverify dependent local commits and
  generated artifacts.
- Use a follow-up commit after a push, promotion, release, external pin, or any
  other point where someone outside the current local work can rely on the
  revision.
- Do not reset, discard, force-push, rewrite published history, or create a
  branch without authority from the user or repository policy.
- Verify the intended diff before committing and the remote state after pushing.
- Make rollbacks additive through a reviewed revert unless policy says otherwise.

## Repository-local rules

Eon Desktop is the repository for Eon for desktop. Its Venus subsystem
materializes Orbit-authored presentation state and sends semantic interaction.
Eon Sessions contains Orbit, which remains the sole owner of PTYs and terminal
authority; Eon owns product orchestration, policy, composition, and distribution.

## Status

This repository implements the accepted `ven-upt.2` first Linux slice using the
`ven-upt.1` architecture and dependency selection. Further product expansion
remains inactive.

## Product boundary

Venus consumes one exact accepted Orbit protocol revision. It may validate and
render structured presentation frames, collect native input, send semantic
events and resize requests, and explain client-visible failures.

Venus must not own a PTY, parse raw PTY output, instantiate another terminal
emulator, answer terminal queries, reconstruct hidden terminal state, or keep a
second protocol schema. Report an insufficient Orbit contract to Orbit instead
of compensating in the client.

The initial slice is one Linux window attached to one local Orbit session. It
does not include tabs, panes, sidebars, popups, settings, visual effects,
configuration, remote or web access, plugins, shell integration, compatibility,
macOS implementation, packaging, or distribution.

A new Venus module is product scope, not an implementation detail.

## Contract index

`docs/CONTRACTS.md` is the canonical index of accepted behavior, ownership,
proof status, checks, and gaps. Contract IDs are stable and repository-qualified
as `VEN-C*`; never renumber or reuse them.

Every product implementation Bead names the Venus contracts it changes, proves,
consumes, hardens, or preserves and maps each consumed Orbit contract to its
exact proof revision. Repository tooling and documentation Beads explicitly
state that they change no product contract. Stop for user approval before
adding, changing, replacing, or retiring a contract.

`Proved` means the index names an accepted proof-bearing Git commit and the
canonical checks that passed for that exact revision. Uncommitted evidence is
only a candidate. Later work touching a proved owner must rerun its indexed
checks and advance the exact proof revision or record the remaining gap.

## One active frontier

Keep one active implementation frontier across Eon Sessions, Eon Desktop, and
Eon unless the user authorizes parallel product work. Research and Beads may
prepare Venus without adding production code. Do not build against speculative
Orbit APIs.

Before Venus implementation begins, record the exact accepted Orbit proof
commit and consumed `ORB-C*` revisions. Any boundary gap returns to Orbit. A
compatible or breaking change names all known consumers and the update order;
adapters and compatibility windows require explicit user choice.

## Execution baseline

Read-only discovery needs no run comment. Before the first production-code,
test, manifest, or generated-fixture edit for an implementation Bead, claim it
and add an append-only `Execution baseline` comment containing:

- current `HEAD` and `git hash-object AGENTS.md`;
- the Bead `updated_at`, affected `VEN-C*` contracts, and consumed Orbit proofs;
- intended production, test, manifest, and generated surfaces;
- pre-existing dirty paths that must be preserved;
- active agent or session identity.

New user direction wins. Record a `Rebaseline` comment before continuing under
a materially changed scope.

## Evidence-first reference gate

`docs/REFERENCES.md` routes design questions to primary sources. Every
implementation Bead classifies each named reference as required before code,
conditional on a named failure, comparison only, or rejected scope. An
unclassified reference is required before code.

After the execution baseline and before production, test, or manifest edits:

1. Reread the complete Bead and comments.
2. Read the relevant reference-map entries.
3. Inspect every required reference at an exact release or commit.
4. Add an append-only `Reference gate` comment recording contracts, identities,
   independently useful mechanisms, rejected surrounding scope, ownership and
   code-shape consequences, and the first meaningful check.
5. Stop if the evidence changes an ownership boundary, requires unapproved
   scope or dependencies, or contradicts the Bead.

Research after implementation does not satisfy this Venus gate. Record license
compatibility at the gate, especially for sources with nonstandard restrictions.

The independent actor analysis in `AP-REFERENCE-001` applies to the user and
Yazelix. When the user names a public project or it materially informs
architecture, treat its code at an exact release or commit as required evidence
for the Venus reference gate. Implement Venus-owned code unless the user
explicitly approves another reuse boundary.

## Crate and framework gate

`docs/CRATES.md` is the durable decision index. For a direct or
architecture-shaping dependency, extend `AP-DEPENDENCY-001` with:

- exact release or commit;
- project-owned LOC removed or introduced;
- direct, transitive, native, build, and Nix cost;
- upgrade burden;
- Linux behavior, macOS feasibility, input methods, accessibility, and future
  browser implications;
- focused proof or measurement for disputed claims.

Add the matrix to an append-only `Crate gate` comment and stop for user approval
before manifest edits. Update `docs/CRATES.md` after an accepted decision.

## Rendering and test discipline

Keep one deterministic path from canonical Orbit frames to Venus-owned draw
inputs. A headless backend or bounded recorded corpus may prove decoding,
composition, damage, ordering, and failure behavior; it does not prove visual
quality or become another product backend.

Do not maintain a handwritten mirror of the Orbit wire schema, parse raw VT, or
claim that a lossy projection proves rich-presentation fidelity. Prefer golden
state transitions and property checks for deterministic composition boundaries,
then focused manual dogfood for native window behavior, text quality, input,
accessibility, and lifecycle.

## Platform discipline

Linux is the first implementation and verification target. The architecture
must remain credible for a native, signed, and notarized macOS client. Keep
window-system, GPU, font, clipboard, input-method, accessibility, and process
integration behind narrow platform owners. Do not create a speculative platform
framework or promise macOS support before the user chooses it.

Every implementation Bead records `neutral`, `isolated platform dependency`, or
`macOS blocker`. A blocker names the exact assumption, affected contracts,
replacement shape, and estimated removal cost, then stops for user choice.

## Protocol exceptions

A missed Venus gate requires stopping and recording the unmet rule. Record any
user-authorized redo or narrowly named exception in an append-only `Protocol
exception` comment with the rule, reason, scope, user decision, retained
evidence, and proof effect. It never pretends the skipped gate passed or carries
into another Bead.

## Git workflow

Work directly on `edge`. Do not merge or promote without explicit user
direction.

## Beads

Use `br` for all issue work. Serialize its writes and run
`br sync --flush-only` before committing or handing off Beads changes.

Use `bv` only with `--robot-*` flags; bare `bv` opens an interactive TUI. Start
read-only triage with `bv --robot-triage --format toon`, then confirm claimable
state with `br show <id> --json` or `br ready --json` before writing.

## Documentation and LOC

Update the README LOC scorecard whenever tracked handwritten project files
change. Exclude `.git/`, Beads data, lock files, and generated artifacts.

Update `CHANGELOG.md` only for accepted user- or consumer-visible behavior,
commands, protocol compatibility, packaging, releases, or proven contracts.
Planning and governance changes do not require a changelog entry.

## Verification

Run the cheapest exact checks for the changed surface. During the planning
phase, verify Markdown paths, contract IDs, Beads state, the LOC scorecard,
`git diff --check`, and a clean or explicitly preserved worktree.

Once Rust exists, keep these green for Rust changes unless the accepted project
surface defines a stricter command:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo check --locked
cargo test --locked
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
git diff --check
```
