# Venus reference routing

References answer a named question; they do not select dependencies or authorize
source reuse. Before code, the implementing Bead records exact releases or
commits, useful mechanisms, rejected surrounding scope, license compatibility,
and consequences for ownership, code shape, and the first check.

## Required before the first client implementation

- Orbit `ORB-C1` through `ORB-C6`, ORBF v1, ORBS v1, and the dependency-free
  `orbit-protocol` 0.1.0 package are accepted at
  `c905bf9610581747f1b07565814b501ca66cfaa6`; `ORB-C7` is partially proved at
  that revision. Venus must consume the package at that exact Git revision and
  must not mirror either codec or its semantic values.
- [FrankenTUI](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankentui) is required for
  backend boundaries, deterministic rendering transitions, and test
  architecture. Inspect its
  [presenter-emission ADR](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankentui/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-002-presenter-emission.md),
  [terminal-backend ADR](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankentui/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-003-terminal-backend.md),
  [backend-strategy ADR](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankentui/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-008-terminal-backend-strategy.md),
  backend traits, headless backend, golden checks, and property-test structure.
  Venus accepts independently justified backend seams, deterministic patch or
  damage transitions, and test patterns—not its TUI, widget, ANSI-presenter, or
  runtime architecture.
- [OpenTUI Rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/opentui_rust) is required
  composition-model evidence. Inspect its buffer layering, clipping, alpha,
  draw-buffer composition, hit grid, double buffering, and separation between
  the rendering engine and the host application loop. Venus does not assume a
  cell-grid renderer, terminal output backend, or OpenTUI dependency.
- [Ghostling](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostling) and
  [libghostty-rs](https://github.com/Uzaaft/libghostty-rs) remain required
  ownership references for native windows, glyphs, GPU integration, callbacks,
  and render-loop boundaries. They do not authorize a second terminal state in
  Venus.

`ven-upt.1` completed this gate at FrankenTUI
`479436597890a14e82676d0067e3917b2a9de8f5`, OpenTUI Rust
`a37bed1d2569fdd5d3bc33ec19c0678cd0cb1cd8`, Ghostling
`f9034e43a50a2f3a8101e35497f486090c1ddd6e`, and libghostty-rs
`72ac98f292879bf9f788fcbb11238c562a1eebe6`. Implementation work must reread
the complete Bead evidence rather than treating these identities as selected
dependencies.

The Jeffrey Emanuel references carry nonstandard licensing. The user explicitly
directed exact-commit inspection for architecture ideas and independently
directs and benefits from it; tool choice alone does not satisfy a restriction
on acting for a named provider. Inspection does not authorize copying,
adaptation, redistribution, incorporation, or dependency selection, which
remain separate license and user-approval gates.

## Selected crate evidence and comparisons

- [winit 0.30.13](https://docs.rs/winit/0.30.13/winit/) owns the window and
  native-event boundary. Its
  [`EventLoopProxy`](https://docs.rs/winit/0.30.13/winit/event_loop/struct.EventLoopProxy.html)
  carries typed wakeups from transport work into the application loop.
- [wgpu 30.0.0](https://docs.rs/wgpu/30.0.0/wgpu/) owns GPU access. Its
  [`CurrentSurfaceTexture`](https://docs.rs/wgpu/30.0.0/wgpu/enum.CurrentSurfaceTexture.html)
  distinguishes success, occlusion, timeout, outdated configuration, and loss
  for bounded renderer recovery.
- [glyphon 0.12.0](https://docs.rs/glyphon/0.12.0/glyphon/) integrates text
  preparation, clipping, raster caches, and mask or color atlases with wgpu 30.
  Its [cosmic-text 0.19.0](https://docs.rs/cosmic-text/0.19.0/cosmic_text/)
  re-export supplies advanced shaping and font fallback. Corpus and native
  checks must still prove terminal-cell fidelity and atlas failure behavior.
- [Sugarloaf](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/tree/main/sugarloaf) is
  conditional on a demonstrated need for its renderer shape.
- [AccessKit 0.24.1](https://docs.rs/accesskit/0.24.1/accesskit/) and
  [accesskit_winit 0.33.2](https://docs.rs/accesskit_winit/0.33.2/accesskit_winit/)
  own native accessibility adaptation. The
  [`ActivationHandler`](https://docs.rs/accesskit/0.24.1/accesskit/trait.ActivationHandler.html)
  requires a real tree by the next display refresh even when the application
  would skip rendering. Venus derives that tree from the accepted scene;
  pointer hit testing follows the last-presented scene.
- [softbuffer 0.4.8](https://docs.rs/softbuffer/0.4.8/softbuffer/) remains the
  software comparison. Its CPU buffer supports damage on selected platforms,
  while AppKit presentation requires a blocking copy.
- [Vello 0.9.0](https://docs.rs/vello/0.9.0/vello/) with
  [Parley 0.11.0](https://docs.rs/parley/0.11.0/parley/) remains the rich-vector
  comparison. Vello identifies its renderer as alpha and requires GPU compute;
  Parley supplies broader rich-text layout than the accepted grid needs.

Compare complete ownership shapes, not isolated crates. The gate measures text
correctness, input methods, accessibility, Linux behavior, macOS feasibility,
future browser implications, owned LOC, dependency/build cost, and maintenance.

The user selected exact-revision Orbit protocol consumption with winit 0.30.13,
wgpu 30.0.0, glyphon 0.12.0 and its cosmic-text 0.19.0 re-export, AccessKit
0.24.1 with accesskit_winit 0.33.2, and pollster 1.0.1. `ven-upt.2` completed the
reference and crate gates before implementing that shape.

## Rejected initial routing

- Rio VT is not a Venus dependency; replacing Orbit's terminal engine is an
  Orbit decision after a concrete engine failure.
- librio matters only for a separately authorized non-Rust consumer.
- Ratatui may support a lossy diagnostic client but cannot prove the native
  Venus or rich-presentation contracts.
- Qwertty targets controlling-terminal applications and does not provide the
  native client foundation.
